# ğŸ§  Singly Linked List in Python

This project is a basic implementation of a **singly linked list** using Python. I developed it independently as part of my data structures learning journey.

## âœ¨ Features

- Insert at beginning, end, or specific index
- Delete from beginning, end, or specific index
- Reverse the linked list
- Print and calculate the length


## ğŸ“Œ Sample Output

```
143 ==> 100 ==> 5 ==> 7 ==> 8 ==> 9 ==> 10 ==> 11 ==> 800 ==> 345 ==> 8700 ==> 12 ==> 13 ==> None
13 ==> 12 ==> 8700 ==> 345 ==> 800 ==> 11 ==> 10 ==> 9 ==> 8 ==> 7 ==> 5 ==> 100 ==> 143 ==> None
```

## ğŸ“š What I Learned

- Node creation and pointer manipulation
- Memory handling using object references
- Error handling and edge case management

## ğŸš€ Next Goals

- Implement Doubly and Circular Linked Lists
- Explore Linked Lists using OOP best practices
